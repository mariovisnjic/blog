    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>My brother approached me with a simple request: "I need a simple website that displays the services I provide, as cheaply as possible, ideally for free."</p>

    <p>This is the third rendition of this website. The first one was React app because I was learning React at the time. The Second was WordPress because I was going for simplicity.
    After he forgot to pay for hosting for the WordPress site and the site got deleted, I had the freedom of choice to restart in a new way.</p>

    <p>The website is not the primary source of leads for his company, so I have a lot of freedom.</p>

    <h2>Stack</h2>
    <p>I'm <strong>obsessed with keeping it simple recently</strong>, so my first reaction was HTML + CSS and nothing else. Remembered that Bootstrap 5 has template examples of full pages which can be used for free.
    Proud to say that I did not add a line of JavaScript in it.
    Since it is a static page, I used Netlify to host it.
    The first version of the new website was up and running in 15 minutes. The Croatian government provides a free domain for your business as long it is a similar name to a registered company.</p>

    <p>Given template needed a few changes and was ready to run:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I reused all the copy from before</li>
        <li>Changed images from .png to .webp</li>
        <li>Defer image loads</li>
        <li>Change Bootstrap and Bootstrap icons to be imported from cdn</li>
        <li>Small fixes based on lighthouse suggestions</li>
        <li>Automate Netlify forms with Captcha to work and send email correctly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lighthouse score</h2>

    <p>In the end, all was done in few hours purely because of me wanting to optimize it as much as possible.</p>
