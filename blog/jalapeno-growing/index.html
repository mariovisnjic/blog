        <h1 class="mb-0">My two-year project of growing jalapeños</h1>
        <time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

        <sketchy-hr  path-prefix="../../"></sketchy-hr>
        <p>From writing last time till now, I have completely redone looks of the blog, and it is completely static without any framework.</p>

        <p>
            I like eating jalapeños.
            They are just right amount of hot for me and are bringing nice taste of green pepper.
            Every developer has a dream of leaving all technology behind and becoming a farmer.
            So instead of usual online ordering, I wanted to see if I could grow one and enjoy a reward of hard work.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth</h2>

        <p>
            Started with 20 seeds of jalapeño and hot portugal. All of it is gonna be indoors since I don't have other option.
            Pretty sure that I planted them too early in the year, they took a while to come out.
            Also, it should complete whole growth in a year.
            For me, it took two. My guess is very cold spring in first year.

        </p>
        <p>

            From 20 seeds, 11 sprouted nicely, over time I cut them down to 3 largest and strongest to replant into larger pots.
            Didn't have enough space to keep them all. Survival of the fittest?
        <br>
            Anyway, here is a gif of whole growth cycle of a plant:

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>
            I enjoy eating them with salads or adding them to meals that are lacking a bit of kick.
            However, three plants produce a lot of peppers, so I decided to make two sauces. One based on peppers and other cooked with tomatoes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was surprised how easy all of it is. <br>
            Just put it in a dirt, give it sun, warmth and water. <br>
            When it is bigger, pluck some leaves and branches that are messing with growth. <br>
            Peppers are ready to be picked when they get "stretch marks"
        </p>
        <p>
            And that is it. I spent more of my time moving them around the apartment so they don't stand in a way and writing this article than actually taking care of them.
            In the end I gave them away. They gave another round of peppers. Good for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude. It was easier than expected. Might return to it when I have some patch of land to grow them properly.
