    <h1 class="mb-0">Learning Go by solving the AoC 2022.</h1>
    <time>Aug 31, 2023</time>

    <sketchy-hr></sketchy-hr>
    <p>I want to learn a new language. I do not want to be stuck on MERN stack forever but be a well-rounded dev.</p>
    <p>Python was the initial idea, and I had a chance to fiddle with it on RaspberryPi. Even thought the syntax is basic and readable; it did not stick with me.
        Golang was my choice as I wanted to do one more high-level before diving into some low-level language.</p>
    <p>Two things I know about Go are that it is growing quick in terms of adoption rate, and that you initiate and assign variable with ”:=“</p>

    <h2>Day 1 and 2 tasks</h2>

    <p>My plan is simple. I am going to go through all tasks and just google when I need something.</p>
    <p>Type system feels great, and I like that compiler behaves like Typescript with strict: true.</p>
    <p>The First obstacle was reading a file and parsing it to an output which is useful.
        A bit of copy-pasting was already working, and on second tasks I already had a feeling what was going on and was able to adapt it to a new task. One thing constantly bugging me is my habit of writing single quote marks (’) for strings. It seems to be reserved for something called runes, and currently I have no idea what those are.</p>
    <p>I had two other things to keep happening which made me reevaluate my approach:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I noticed that constants and variables can be initiated in a few different ways. Without value but with types, no types with value, that big const which holds a lot of constants in regular brackets.</li>
        <li>I needed indexOf for an array, and by quick googling and not much exploration, found out that there is none but had to implement my own.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So while hard-coding my last rock paper scissor against the elves in task 2, I decided it is going to be smarter for me to go through language documentation properly and then continue with the tasks.</p>

    <h2>Day 3-6</h2>
    <p>Syntax is slowly getting into my fingers. I figured out there is a set of standard libraries like “strings”, which has most of what JS has covered. Even though I have come to peace with looping through arrays, I wish there was a library for arrays.</p>
    <p>Some things are syntactically just straight up beautiful. This is how you get string or array split in the middle, and it is already my favourite thing.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
 mid := len(slice) / 2
left := slice[:mid]
right := slice[mid:]
    </code></pre>

    <sketchy-hr></sketchy-hr>

    <h2>Day 7,8 and 9</h2>
    <p>First of all, I never practiced LeetCode. I never created a node tree, traversed it or compared binary trees.
        I know these words purely because of Reddit and YouTube.</p>
    <p>So this whole task was an adventure of its own regardless of language used. The code creates actual node tree, is full recursion, but in the end, it sorts its stuff out and spits the correct results out.</p>
    <p>While day 8 didn’t teach me anything new for Go, it did show me that it is easier to practice and debug on a smaller set of data and then provide full input for a task.</p>

    <h2>Anecdote from the job</h2>
    <p>I had a task two months ago where I needed to find overlaps between dates.
        As long as overlapped days are less than 15 within a month, it should add 50 to a total, and if it is more than that, then it should add 32 to a total.</p>
    <p>This was a nightmare of calculation which took coworker and me almost a week to solve properly while handling dates in JavaScript, finding previous instances of date ranges and their overlaps.</p>
    <p>Turned out that calculation had bugs all over the place miscalculating at seemingly random times. This time I approached it clear head and recognized that it can be structured and solved in a much simpler way than it was. It took me an hour of implementing, testing a new solution and running it in production. The Advent of code has armed me with a more algorithmic approach.</p>
    <p>The solution ended up bug free and reduced from 400 lines of code to 250 more readable ones.</p>

    <h2>Finishing it early</h2>

    <p>While I planned, and I still plan, to finish the whole Advent of Code it will be cut short for now.</p>
    <p>As usual, life happens, and I have to prioritize other things. I have gotten a new opportunity at a new job. Main stack is different from what I am used to, and I have to learn a lot of new things.</p>
    <p>I will be back to finish the Advent of Code and learn Go in the process as it seems to be a great language and Advent seems to be a great way of learning it.</p>
