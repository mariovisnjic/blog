    <p>Website designs change over time. It used to have intricate designs with lots of animations and effects. Over time it became more minimalistic and simple.</p>

    <p>While some of them changed completely, some of them stayed became cyclical.
    For example border-radius. It was a thing, then it wasn't, now it is again.</p>

    <p>Some of the approaches were just fun to look at. For example brutalism.
    It seemed to break all the rules of design. Currently, you use soft box shadows and rounded corners.
    Brutalism was the opposite. It was all about sharp edges, full shadows and lots of colors.</p>

    <p>While it was fun to look at, it was not realistic to use in professional projects. Now I have a chance to use it in my personal blog.</p>
