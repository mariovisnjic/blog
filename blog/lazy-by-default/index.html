    <p>I am lazy by default.</p>

    <p>When I see something on a floor, on a table, my first reaction is “I don’t care”.
        Is the washing machine or dishwasher done? I don’t care.</p>

    <p>But family life changes things. Things won’t clean themselves. Now, I pick up stuff, not because I care, but because it won’t vanish.</p>

    <p>I did not develop habit of cleaning after myself or others. Each time I do it, I have to manually override my default “I don’t care” reaction. My brain does not pick up habits easily, and I can be doing something for years only to drop it the next day if needed.</p>

    <p>Over time, noticed that I am doing same thing with coding. I am repeating myself more than two times, “I don’t care” reaction kicks in. Then, I have to manually override it and refactor. Noticed code smell on a code even if it is not part of current task? Pick the “trash” up and refactor it. So, purely out of laziness, I picked up a useful skill of leaving code cleaner than I found it.</p>

    <p>Still it is everyday struggle to recognize laziness and override it. But it is worth it.</p>
